    <h2>Chickpea Soup with Noodles</h2>
    <p>A hearty vegan soup that's easy to make with whatever vegetables suit your fancy.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="pretty-list">
        <li>EVOO</li>
        <li>3 sprigs of thyme</li>
        <li>1 sliced yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 thinly sliced leek</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup white wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white miso</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>2 parsnips</li>
        <li>1 rutabaga</li>
        <li>3 stalks of celery, sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups chickpeas</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>zest and juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>10 sprigs of parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>4oz pappardelle</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a soup pot, heat a glug of olive oil over medium heat. Add the thyme (or herbs de Provence) and briefly fry, 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the onion, leek, and garlic, plus a big pinch of salt, and reduce heat to medium-low. Sweat the mixture until soft, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the white wine and reduce by half.</li>
        <li>Dissolve the miso into 8 cups of water. If it doesn't blend completely, don't worry, it will as the soup simmersâ€”this just helps it along.</li>
        <li>Add the root vegetables, chickpeas, and miso water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until all the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small frying pan, lightly toast the red pepper flakes over medium-high heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine 1/2 cup of olive oil, the lemon zest, lemon juice, parsley, and a pinch of salt. Add the warm red pepper to the mixture.</li>
        <li>When the vegetables are tender, taste and adjust the salt as desired. Add the pasta and simmer until tender, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Divide the soup into 4 bowls and top with a hefty spoonful of the parsley relish.</li>
    </ol>
